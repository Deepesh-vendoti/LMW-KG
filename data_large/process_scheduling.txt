Process Scheduling Algorithms

Process scheduling is a fundamental component of operating systems that determines which process runs when. The scheduler must balance efficiency, fairness, and responsiveness.

1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)

FCFS is the simplest scheduling algorithm where processes are executed in the order they arrive.

Characteristics:
- Non-preemptive: Once a process starts, it runs to completion
- Simple to implement and understand
- Can lead to convoy effect (short processes waiting behind long ones)
- Average waiting time can be high

Example: Process A (10ms), Process B (5ms), Process C (8ms)
Execution order: A → B → C
Total time: 23ms

2. Shortest Job First (SJF)

SJF schedules processes based on their burst time, with shorter jobs getting priority.

Characteristics:
- Can be preemptive (SJF) or non-preemptive (SJN)
- Minimizes average waiting time
- Requires knowledge of process burst times
- Can cause starvation for longer processes

3. Round Robin (RR)

Round Robin assigns a fixed time quantum to each process in a circular manner.

Characteristics:
- Preemptive scheduling
- Fair to all processes
- Good for time-sharing systems
- Performance depends on time quantum size
- No starvation

4. Priority Scheduling

Priority scheduling assigns priorities to processes and executes higher priority processes first.

Characteristics:
- Can be preemptive or non-preemptive
- Allows for process prioritization
- Can cause priority inversion
- May lead to starvation of low-priority processes

5. Multi-Level Queue Scheduling

This algorithm uses multiple queues with different priorities and scheduling algorithms.

Characteristics:
- Processes are permanently assigned to queues
- Higher priority queues are served first
- Different scheduling algorithms per queue
- Can be complex to implement

6. Multi-Level Feedback Queue

Similar to multi-level queue but allows processes to move between queues.

Characteristics:
- Processes can change priority levels
- Prevents starvation
- More complex than simple algorithms
- Adapts to process behavior

Performance Metrics:

- Turnaround Time: Total time from arrival to completion
- Waiting Time: Total time spent waiting in ready queue
- Response Time: Time from request to first response
- CPU Utilization: Percentage of time CPU is busy
- Throughput: Number of processes completed per time unit
