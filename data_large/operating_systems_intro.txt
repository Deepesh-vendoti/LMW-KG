Operating Systems: Introduction and Fundamentals

1. What is an Operating System?

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and the user.

Key Functions:
- Process Management: Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes
- Memory Management: Allocating and deallocating memory space
- File System Management: Organizing and tracking files and directories
- Device Management: Controlling peripheral devices
- Security and Access Control: Protecting system resources

2. Process Management

A process is a program in execution. The operating system manages processes through:
- Process Creation: Allocating resources for new processes
- Process Scheduling: Determining which process runs when
- Process Synchronization: Coordinating multiple processes
- Process Communication: Enabling processes to exchange data

3. Memory Management

Memory management involves:
- Memory Allocation: Assigning memory to processes
- Memory Protection: Preventing unauthorized access
- Virtual Memory: Using disk space as an extension of RAM
- Memory Paging: Dividing memory into fixed-size blocks

4. File Systems

File systems organize data on storage devices:
- File Organization: Hierarchical directory structures
- File Operations: Create, read, write, delete files
- File Permissions: Controlling access to files
- File Recovery: Backup and restoration mechanisms

5. Device Management

The OS manages hardware devices through:
- Device Drivers: Software interfaces for hardware
- I/O Scheduling: Optimizing input/output operations
- Device Allocation: Managing shared devices
- Error Handling: Detecting and responding to device failures
